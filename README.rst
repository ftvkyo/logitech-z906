LogitechÂ® Z906 Surround Sound Speakers
======================================

Overview
--------

5.1 surround sound speaker system with the amplifier built into the subwoofer
and managed by an external control console attached using a
`DE-15 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature>`_ connector.

Purpose
-------

Provide unofficial documentation of the serial protocol and possible
firmware/configuration modifications.

The console `firmware <firmware.rst>`_ can be modified to:

* Automatically turn the speakers on when power is supplied.
* Change the automatic standby idle timeout from the default 2 hours.

Automatic standby
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable/disable automatic standby, hold the "level" button for 5 seconds
(until the level change light goes out). There's no obvious indication that
anything has changed but the stored effects for all of the inputs will have been
reordered because the console sends them in the wrong order (check by turning
the console off and on).

To get this into a known state (automatic standby enabled), hold down the
"input" button for 8 seconds while in standby. This will reset all settings.
